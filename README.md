# Capstone Description

## Title: GenAI in Support of Wargaming

## Description

Creating believable, realistic, and immersive scenarios in support of wargaming objectives 
requires significant time and subject matter expertise. This capstone project proposes developing a 
software system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the creation of critical wargaming 
artifacts, such as "Road to War" briefs, concepts of operations, intelligence summaries, operational plans, 
and operations orders. By utilizing an LLM system capable of generating detailed, context-specific 
scenarios and associated products, this project aims to greatly accelerate the wargaming process, 
potentially enhance the quality of the generated outputs, and reduce the need for extensive human resources. 
The project may explore LLM techniques such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), fine-tuning, and 
prompt engineering, while also developing a user-friendly interface and ensuring real-time adaptability 
based on user feedback. The final product will serve as a proof of concept, demonstrating how LLMs can 
be harnessed to enhance and expedite the wargaming process.

## POC

[LtCol Scotty Black](mailto:scotty.black@nps.edu )

## First Steps

- Create a small LLM that can create 5 paragraph orders.
- Nothing has really been done in this field yet, so we can pretty much do anything.
- Take a look at the wargaming documents and the wargaming plans.
